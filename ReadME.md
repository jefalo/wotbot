# Setup #
0. Install .net framework 4.0

1. rename the original res\_mods to anything else you like

2. put this whole folder into World\_of\_Tanks folder

3. replace %appdata%\Wargaming.net\WorldOfTanks\preferences.xml with preferences\_bot.xml (better to keep an original copy)

4. open worldoftanks.exe make it in window mode (rather than full screen), and better make the graphics quality to minimum

5. make sure it will only battle in Standard Mode (cancel encounter battle and assault battle)

6. execute tankbot.exe

7. press start, and focus the mouse into it will use the first 4 tanks to random battle (settings can be changed in  config\tank\_carousel\_order.ini (better use tier 4-6 HT)

## Notice ##
don't drag the WOT window after press the START

# Future Work #

## side effect if the tankbot crashed ##
There will be an process named key\_map.exe left alive (need to close it manually)


## something sucks ##
The whole file is quite large

The aiming procedure is quite a shit

The whole efficiency is around 400-500

The program is probably crash for some reason.

You may send the tankbot.log as well as python.log and xvm.log to duck.german2@gmail.com
